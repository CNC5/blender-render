Intended use
--
These scripts are made for auto preparation and rendering on different rented hardware.

Scripts naming
--
The first word is telling about the GPU that is supposed to be in use on the machine.
Next 2 words in the name are telling you for which platform the script was intended (for example *-ubuntu22-selectel* means that the script is supposed to be executed on ubuntu machine of version 22, rented from selectel).

Procedure
--
Scripts require you to first load the scene in the storage container of some sort, for example of selectel - to the cloud storage container and create a user for S3 access.
