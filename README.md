These scripts are made for auto preparation and rendering on different rented hardware.

Last 2 words in the name are telling you for which platform the script was intended (for example *-ubuntu22-selectel.sh means that the script is supposed to be executed on ubuntu machine of version 22, rented from selectel).

The first word is telling about the GPU that is supposed to be in use on the machine.

Scripts require you to first load the scene in the storage container of some sort, for example of selectel - to the cloud storage container.
